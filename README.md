## Hello!
My name is **Mel**. I am an aspiring Data Scientist from the Philippines. I was supposed to be Maths Teacher, but my heart really goes out for crunching numbers and turning them into actionable insights. 

## What is my mission? 
I see myself as an *advocate of data fluency for my fellow Filipino in the marginalized sectors*. To do that, I first need to build my own skills.

## Tools that I use:
* Python
* SQL
* Tableau
