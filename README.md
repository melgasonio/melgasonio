### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

## Who am I? 
My name is **Mel**. I am an aspiring Data Scientist from the Philippines. I was supposed to be Maths Teacher, but my heart really goes out for crunching data.

## What is my mission? 
I see myself as a data scientist and advocate of data fluency for my fellow Filipino in the marginilized sectors. But before I will be able to do that, I first need to build my own skills.

## Tools that I use:
*Python
*SQL
*Tableau
